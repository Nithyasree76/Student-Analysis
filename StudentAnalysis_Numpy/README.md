# Student Performance Analysis using NumPy

## Overview
This project analyzes student academic data using NumPy. It performs statistical analysis, ranking, grading, and subject-wise normalization using vectorized operations.

## Features
- Subject-wise average calculation
- Student-wise average calculation
- Top 5 student identification
- Hardest and easiest subject detection
- Grade classification system
- Subject-wise Min–Max normalization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install NumPy:
   pip install numpy

2. Run:
   python main.py

## Learning Outcomes
- Array slicing and axis operations
- Ranking using argsort
- Conditional grading using NumPy
- Feature scaling (Min–Max normalization)
